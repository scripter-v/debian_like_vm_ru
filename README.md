# Debian like VM
There is adaptation of [tutum-debian](https://github.com/tutumcloud/tutum-debian) and [baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) as a light-weight alternative to the classic VM.
Container runs with SSH access. Read more [here](https://github.com/tutumcloud/tutum-debian/blob/master/README.md#running-tutumdebian) about SSH settings.
